# Basic AI Agents

Here we will implement a basic AI Agent in Python. Things we will do includes:

- Setup Environment including Python virtual environment and  install necessary packages
- Define Core Functions that the agent can call to perform tasks
- Create a Text Generation Function, use an API to generate responses based on user input, send messages to the model and receive replies.
- Integrate Logic for Agent Actions, use a loop or a system prompt that allows the agent to “think,” decide on an action, execute it, and respond. This mimics human problem-solving by combining reasoning and external function calls.

How to run the app

```bash
python app.py
```

Sample chats:
What is the response time for google.com
Tell me a story about a brave knight

Type 'exit' to quit
